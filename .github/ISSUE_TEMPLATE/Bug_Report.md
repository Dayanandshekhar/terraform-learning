name: üêõ Bug Report
about: If something isn't working as expected ü§î.

---

<!---
Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.

### Terraform CLI and Terraform AWS Provider Version

<!--- Please run `terraform -v` to show the Terraform core version and provider version(s). If you are not running the latest version of Terraform or the provider, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed. [Terraform documentation on provider versioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions). --->

$ terraform --version
Terraform v1.2.6
on windows_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.75.2

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 1.2.7. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

### Affected Resource(s)

<!--- Please list the affected resources and data sources. --->
The following resources are affected when I run command terraform plan, even though there is no change in the terraform configuration file nor manually did the changes.
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "lifecycle1"  and
resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "logging_bucket"

* aws_XXXXX

### Panic Output

<!--- If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`. --->
No
### Expected Behavior

<!--- What should have happened? --->

The expected output should be " Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy "

It should give the output as "0 to change" , because I did not change any thing in the terraform configuration file or code

### Actual Behavior

<!--- What actually happened? --->

The output is : " Plan: 0 to add, 2 to change, 0 to destroy "

when running the command terraform plan getting above plan as " 2 to change" which unexpected

### Steps to Reproduce

<!--- Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue. --->

If you will use the terraform code which I have shared in the issue I shared

1. `terraform workspace new dev`
2. `terraform workspace select dev`
3. `terraform plan`
4. `terraform apply`
5. after successfully created the infrastructure, when running terraform plan, getting the unexpected output, also I checked to see the output for terraform apply, but getting the same result/output
6. again run `terraform plan`
