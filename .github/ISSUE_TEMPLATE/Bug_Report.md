about: unexpected behavior of Running SSM Document ü§î.

<!---
Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.

}



### Debug Output

after running terraform apply I got:
aws_ssm_document.SSM-test-DOC1: Refreshing state... [id=SSM-DOC-test1]
aws_ssm_association.ec2ssm1: Refreshing state... [id=6c19c445-e829-41b1-afa1-0fea2c219582]
aws_ssm_document.SSM-test-DOC1: Modifying... [id=SSM-DOC-test1]
aws_ssm_document.SSM-test-DOC1: Modifications complete after 5s [id=SSM-DOC-test1]
                        

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
-----------
BUT:
into the SSM -> Run Command -> command History
  the command failed due to failure in downloading the s3 bucket file specified in the 'sourceinf' block although it exists there!
                        
### Panic Output

NONE

### Expected Behavior

to a status of Success in the SSM -> Run Command -> command History
(which I get when running the command manually in the console using the Run Commnad option)
  
### Actual Behavior

downloading the S3 script file failed -> running the command failed, and got the following error:

invalid format in plugin properties map[destinationPath:home/ec2-user sourceInfo:map[path:https://test-ssm-document-2.s3.amazonaws.com/getting.sh] sourceType:S3];

error json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field DownloadContentPlugin.sourceInfo of type string

  
### Steps to Reproduce


1. `create a script file and upload it to S3 bucket`
2. `create an EC2 instance in the same region of the S3 bucket with SSM role to run SSM command on it`
3. `update the ec2 id and s3 file path in the .tf file`
4. `terraform apply`
5. `in the terminal everything should work fine`
6. `log into the aws console -> SSM -> Run Command -> Command History`
7. `Status of the last Command will be "failed"`
