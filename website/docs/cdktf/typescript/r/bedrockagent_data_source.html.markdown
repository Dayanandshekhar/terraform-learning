# Resource: aws_bedrockagent_data_source

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Agents for Amazon Bedrock Data Source.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BedrockagentDataSource } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new BedrockagentDataSource(this, "example", {});
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `example_arg` - (Required) Concise argument description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

The following arguments are optional:

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Data Source. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.
* `example_attribute` - Concise description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

* `create` - (Default `30m`)
* `delete` - (Default `30m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Data Source using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { BedrockagentDataSource } from "./.gen/providers/aws/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    BedrockagentDataSource.generateConfigForImport(
      this,
      "example",
      "data_source-id-12345678"
    );
  }
}

```

Using `terraform import`, import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Data Source using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_bedrockagent_data_source.example data_source-id-12345678
```
