## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Knowledge Base. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `60m`)
* `update` - (Default `180m`)
* `delete` - (Default `90m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.bedrockagent_knowledge_base import BedrockagentKnowledgeBase
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        BedrockagentKnowledgeBase.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "Q1IYMH6GQG")
```

Using `terraform import`, import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base using the `Q1IYMH6GQG`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_bedrockagent_knowledge_base.example Q1IYMH6GQG
```
