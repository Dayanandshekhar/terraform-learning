from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.servicecatalogappregistry_application import ServicecatalogappregistryApplication
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ServicecatalogappregistryApplication.generate_config_for_import(self, "example", "application-id-12345678")
```

Using `terraform import`, import AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry Application using the `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_servicecatalogappregistry_application.example application-id-12345678
