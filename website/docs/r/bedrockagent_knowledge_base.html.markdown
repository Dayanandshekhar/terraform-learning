# Resource: aws_bedrockagent_knowledge_base

Terraform resource for managing an AWS Agents for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_bedrockagent_knowledge_base" "test" {
  name     = "example"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.example.arn
  knowledge_base_configuration {
    vector_knowledge_base_configuration {
      embedding_model_arn = "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v1"
    }
    type = "VECTOR"
  }
  storage_configuration {
    type = "OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS"
    opensearch_serverless_configuration {
      collection_arn    = "arn:aws:aoss:us-west-2:1234567890:collection/142bezjddq707i5stcrf"
      vector_index_name = "bedrock-knowledge-base-default-index"
      field_mapping {
        vector_field   = "bedrock-knowledge-base-default-vector"
        text_field     = "AMAZON_BEDROCK_TEXT_CHUNK"
        metadata_field = "AMAZON_BEDROCK_METADATA"

If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

Knowledge Base Configuration supports the following:

* `type` – (Required) The type of data that the data source is converted into for the knowledge base.
* `vector_knowledge_base_configuration` – (Optional) Contains details about the embeddings model that'sused to   convert the data source.

Vector Knowledge Base Configuration supports the following:

* `embedding_model_arn` – (Required) The ARN of the model used to create vector embeddings for the knowledge base.

Storage Configuration supports the following:

* `type` – (Required) The vector store service in which the knowledge base is stored.Valid Values: OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS | PINECONE | REDIS_ENTERPRISE_CLOUD | RDS
* `pinecone_configuration` – (Optional) Contains the storage configuration of the knowledge base in Pinecone.
* `rds_configuration` – (Optional) Contains details about the storage configuration of the knowledge base in Amazon RDS. For more information, see Create a vector index in Amazon RDS.
* `redis_enterprise_cloud_configuration` – (Optional) Contains the storage configuration of the knowledge base in Redis Enterprise Cloud.
* `opensearch_serverless_configuration` – (Optional) Contains the storage configuration of the knowledge base in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

Pinecone Configuration supports the following:

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `arn` - ARN of the Knowledge Base. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.

## Timeouts

[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):

* `create` - (Default `60m`)
* `update` - (Default `180m`)
* `delete` - (Default `90m`)

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base using the `example_id_arg`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_bedrockagent_knowledge_base.example
  id = "Q1IYMH6GQG"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import Agents for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base using the `Q1IYMH6GQG`. For example:

```console
% terraform import aws_bedrockagent_knowledge_base.example Q1IYMH6GQG
```
