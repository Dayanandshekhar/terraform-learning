# Resource: aws_dms_endpoint

Provides a DMS (Data Migration Service) endpoint resource. DMS endpoints can be created, updated, deleted, and imported.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

~> **Note:** We discourage using `extra_connection_attributes`. AWS is planning to **deprecate** this argument. Use the `<engine>_settings` arguments (_e.g._, `s3_settings`) instead. If you do use `extra_connection_attributes`, we recommend that you duplicate any settings in the `<engine>_settings` arguments to avoid Terraform reporting incorrect differences.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
# Create a new endpoint
resource "aws_dms_endpoint" "test" {
  certificate_arn             = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  database_name               = "test"
  endpoint_id                 = "test-dms-endpoint-tf"
  endpoint_type               = "source"
  engine_name                 = "aurora"
  extra_connection_attributes = ""
  kms_key_arn                 = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  password                    = "test"
  port                        = 3306
  server_name                 = "test"
  ssl_mode                    = "none"

  tags = {
    Name = "test"
  }

  username = "test"
}
```

### S3 Example

AWS is planning to deprecate `extra_connection_attributes` so we recommend using `s3_settings` instead as shown below.

```terraform
resource "aws_dms_endpoint" "example" {
  endpoint_type = "target"
  engine_name   = "s3"
  endpoint_id   = "milajovovich"

  s3_settings {
    bucket_folder                    = "some/prefix"
    bucket_name                      = aws_s3_bucket.test.id
    cdc_path                         = "cdc"
    data_format                      = "parquet"
    date_partition_enabled           = true   
    include_op_for_full_load         = true
    parquet_timestamp_in_millisecond = true
    parquet_version                  = "parquet-2-0"
    service_access_role_arn          = aws_iam_role.example.arn
    timestamp_column_name            = "timestamp"
  }
}
```

* `message_max_bytes` - (Optional) Maximum size in bytes for records created on the endpoint Default is `1,000,000`.
* `no_hex_prefix` - (Optional) Set this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' prefix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by default, AWS DMS adds a '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in hexadecimal format moving from an Oracle source to a Kafka target. Use the `no_hex_prefix` endpoint setting to enable migration of RAW data type columns without adding the `'0x'` prefix.
* `partition_include_schema_table` - (Optional) Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the partition type is `primary-key-type`. Doing this increases data distribution among Kafka partitions. For example, suppose that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table has only limited range for a primary key. In this case, the same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the same partition, which causes throttling. Default is `false`.
* `sasl_password` - (Optional) Secure password you created when you first set up your MSK cluster to validate a client identity and make an encrypted connection between server and client using SASL-SSL authentication.
* `sasl_username` - (Optional) Secure user name you created when you first set up your MSK cluster to validate a client identity and make an encrypted connection between server and client using SASL-SSL authentication.
* `security_protocol` - (Optional) Set secure connection to a Kafka target endpoint using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Options include `ssl-encryption`, `ssl-authentication`, and `sasl-ssl`. `sasl-ssl` requires `sasl_username` and `sasl_password`.
* `ssl_ca_certificate_arn` - (Optional) ARN for the private certificate authority (CA) cert that AWS DMS uses to securely connect to your Kafka target endpoint.
* `ssl_client_certificate_arn` - (Optional) ARN of the client certificate used to securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

* `no_hex_prefix` - (Optional) Set this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' prefix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by default, AWS DMS adds a '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in hexadecimal format moving from an Oracle source to a Kinesis target. Use the `no_hex_prefix` endpoint setting to enable migration of RAW data type columns without adding the `'0x'` prefix.
* `partition_include_schema_table` - (Optional) Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the partition type is primary-key-type. Default is `false`.
* `service_access_role_arn` - (Optional) ARN of the IAM Role with permissions to write to the Kinesis data stream.

### oracle_settings

-> Additional information can be found in the [Using Apache Kafka as a Target for AWS Database Migration Service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Kafka.html).

* `access_alternate_directly` - (Optional) Set to `false` in order to use the Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source. This tells the DMS instance to not access redo logs through any specified path prefix replacement using direct file access.
* `additional_archived_log_dest_id` - (Optional) Use with `archived_log_dest_id` in a primary/standby setup. This attribute is useful in the case of a switchover. In this case, AWS DMS needs to know which destination to get archive redo logs from to read changes. This need arises because the previous primary instance is now a standby instance after switchover.
* `add_supplemental_logging` - (Optional) Set up table-level supplemental logging for the Oracle database. This enables PRIMARY KEY supplemental logging on all tables selected for a migration task. If you use this option, you still need to enable database-level supplemental logging.
* `allow_select_nested_tables` - (Optional) Whether to enable replication of Oracle tables containing columns that are nested tables or defined types.
* `archived_log_dest_id` - (Optional) ID of the destination for the archived redo logs. This value should be the same as a number in the `dest_id` column of the `v$archived_log view`. If you work with an additional redo log destination, use the `additional_archived_log_dest_id` option to specify the additional destination ID. Doing this improves performance by ensuring that the correct logs are accessed from the outset.
* `archived_logs_only` - (Optional) When this field is set to `true`, AWS DMS only accesses the archived redo logs. If the archived redo logs are stored on Oracle ASM only, the AWS DMS user account needs to be granted ASM privileges.
* `asm_password` - (Optional) ASM password. Conflicts with `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_access_role_arn` and `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret_id`.
* `asm_server` - (Optional) ASM server address. Conflicts with `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_access_role_arn` and `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret_id`.
* `asm_user` - (Optional) ASM user name. Conflicts with `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_access_role_arn` and `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret_id`.
* `char_length_semantics` - (Optional) Length of a character column. `char` indicates the character column length is in characters. Otherwise, the character column length is in bytes. Valid values `default`, `char`, `byte`. Default is `default`.
* `direct_path_no_log` - (Optional) When set to `true`, this attribute helps to increase the commit rate on the Oracle target database by writing directly to tables and not writing a trail to database logs.
* `direct_path_parallel_load` - (Optional) Whether, when `use_direct_path_full_load` is `true`, to parallel load. This attribute also only applies when you use the AWS DMS parallel load feature. Note that the target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.
* `enable_homogenous_tablespace` - (Optional) Whether to enable homogenous tablespace replication and create existing tables or indexes under the same tablespace on the target.
* `extra_archived_log_dest_ids` - (Optional) List of IDs of one or more destinations for one or more archived redo logs. These IDs are the values of the `dest_id` column in the `v$archived_log` view. Use this setting with the `archived_log_dest_id` attribute in a primary-to-single setup or a primary-to-multiple-standby setup. For example, in a primary-to-single standby setup you might apply these settings: `archived_Log_Dest_Id = 1` and `extra_archived_log_dest_ids = [2]`. In a primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might apply these settings: `archived_log_dest_id = 1` and `extra_archived_log_dest_ids = [2,3,4]`.
* `fail_tasks_on_lob_truncation` - (Optional) Whether to fail if the actual size of an LOB column is greater than LobMaxSize.
* `number_datatype_scale` - (Optional) Number scale. You can select a scale up to `38`. By default, the NUMBER data type is converted to precision 38, scale 10.
* `oracle_path_prefix` - (Optional) Default Oracle root used to access the redo logs. Set this in order to use the Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source.
* `parallel_asm_read_threads` - (Optional) Number of threads that DMS configures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). Valid values are between `2`-`8`. Default is `2`. Use this attribute together with the `read_ahead_blocks` attribute.
* `read_ahead_blocks` - (Optional) Number of read-ahead blocks that DMS configures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). Valid values are `1000`-`200000`.
* `read_table_space_name` - (Optional) Whether to support tablespace replication.
* `replace_path_prefix` - (Optional) Whether to use the Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source. This setting tells DMS instance to replace the default Oracle root with the specified `use_path_prefix` setting to access the redo logs.
* `retry_interval` - (Optional) Number of seconds that the system waits before resending a query.
* `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_access_role_arn` - (Optional) Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses ASM. The full ARN of the IAM role that specifies AWS DMS as the trusted entity and grants the required permissions to access the `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret`. This `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret` has the secret value that allows access to the Oracle ASM of the endpoint. Conflicts with `asm_user_name`, `asm_password`, and `asm_server_name`.
* `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret_id` - (Optional) Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses ASM. The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the `secrets_manager_oracle_asm_secret` that contains the Oracle ASM connection details for the Oracle endpoint. Conflicts with `asm_user_name`, `asm_password`, and `asm_server_name`.
* `security_db_encryption` - (Optional) Transparent data encryption (TDE) password required by AWM DMS to access Oracle redo logs encrypted by TDE using Binary Reader. It is also the TDE_Password part of the comma-separated value you set to the Password request parameter when you create the endpoint. The `security_db_encryptian` setting is related to this `security_db_encryption_name` setting.
* `security_db_encryption_name` - (Optional) Name of a key used for the transparent data encryption (TDE) of the columns and tablespaces in an Oracle source database that is encrypted using TDE. The key value is the value of the `security_db_encryption` setting.
* `spatial_data_option_to_geo_json_function_name` - (Optional) Custom function to convert SDO_GEOMETRY to GEOJSON format. By default, DMS calls the SDO2GEOJSON custom function if present and accessible.
* `standby_delay_time` - (Optional) Time in minutes for the delay in standby sync. If the source is an Oracle Active Data Guard standby database, use this attribute to specify the time lag between primary and standby databases. In AWS DMS, you can create an Oracle CDC task that uses an Active Data Guard standby instance as a source for replicating ongoing changes. Doing this eliminates the need to connect to an active database that might be in production.
