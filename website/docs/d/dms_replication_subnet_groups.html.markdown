# Data Source: aws_dms_replication_subnet_groups

This resource can be useful for getting back a set of DMS (Database Migration) Replication Subnet Group IDs.

## Example Usage

The following example outputs a set of all VPC IDs associated with a Replication Subnet Group.

```terraform
data "aws_dms_replication_subnet_groups" "example" {}

data "aws_dms_replication_subnet_group" "example" {
  for_each = toset(data.aws_dms_replication_subnet_groups.example.ids)
  replication_subnet_group_id = each.value
}

output "vpc_ids" {
	value = toset([for s in data.aws_dms_replication_subnet_group.this : s.vpc_id])
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.

Filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeReplicationSubnetGroups.html).
  Note that only `replication-subnet-group-id` is currently supported. E.G.

```terraform
data "aws_replication_subnet_groups" "example" {
  filter {
    name   = "replication-subnet-group-id"
	values = [""] # insert values here
}
```

* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. Replication Subnet Groups will be selected if any one of the given values match.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - ARN of the Replication Subnet Groups. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.
* `example_attribute` - Concise description. Do not begin the description with "An", "The", "Defines", "Indicates", or "Specifies," as these are verbose. In other words, "Indicates the amount of storage," can be rewritten as "Amount of storage," without losing any information.
