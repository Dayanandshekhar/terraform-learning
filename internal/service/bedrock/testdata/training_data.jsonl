And, of\ncourse, there will have to be new \"sub-positions\", like the power center\nwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,\nand the \"shooting defenseman\" and the \"point defenseman\".  Finally, we'll\nbe able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. \nSince almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to\nsee Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.  \n\n;-) ;-) ;-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\n\n\"Next time you go over my head, I'll have yours on a platter.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-- Cmdr.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Going into the 1992\/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype.

Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

I found the same ratios for HR.\n\nYear  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   \n1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04\n1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12\n1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20\n1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14\n1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19\n1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24\n1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98\n1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14\n1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97\n1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17\n1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17\n1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96\n1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12\n      1446\/13-->1.11     1444\/13-->1.11\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect \non runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year \nthat it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) \nand a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as \nAtlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.\nStill it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.\n\njohn rickert\nrickert@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu\n\n###\n\n","output":" baseball"}

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.

And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.

There are 30 to 50 Florida\nPanthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National \nPreserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.\n\n\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\" Torrey said.  \n\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\"\n\nMore BIO:\nIn Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders\nin 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four\nconsecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight\nseasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president\nof the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-\noffs in 1968, only their second NHL season.\n\n\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\", said Torrey, 58, a\nnative of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm\nBeach.\n\nJim G.\nother accounts:\ngorycki@sol.cse.fau.edu\njimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"I repeat myself when under stress.

I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.

However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.
